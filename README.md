## Motivating use case

> I want to turn a (data-oriented) markdown file into an elegant data-driven web page

Data-oriented markdown file is the kind of thing in https://github.com/datasets/awesome-data and its issue https://github.com/datasets/awesome-data/issues

I want things like:

* Create charts using react components (in markdown) a la MDX
* Have datasets as markdown files using the frontmatter for metadata
* Datasets within markdown files using backtick notation e.g. \`\`\`dataset
* Embedded csv or json data turned into nie tables
