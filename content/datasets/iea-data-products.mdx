The International Energy Agency (IEA; French: Agence internationale de l'énergie) is a Paris-based autonomous intergovernmental organisation established in the framework of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in 1974 in the wake of the 1973 oil crisis. The IEA was initially dedicated to responding to physical disruptions in the supply of oil, as well as serving as an information source on statistics about the international oil market and other energy sectors. It is best known for the publication of its annual World Energy Outlook. [Wikipedia]

They claim on their site to provide:

> the world’s most authoritative and comprehensive source of global energy data. [We] collect, assess and disseminat energy statistics on supply and demand, compiled into energy balances in addition to a number of other key energy-related indicators, including energy prices, public RD&D and measures of energy efficiency, with other measures in development. https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics

None of their is data is Open and most of it requires a paid subscription (see below for details). A few sample data series are provided for free. A large amount of valuable analysis and graphs are provided on their website (prominently marked "All rights reserved").
